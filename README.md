# LSDefi

Notes on the current LST landscape, in particular, for Rocket Pool Peers who need quick education on the state of Ethereum liquid staking.

## CEX Staking
Centralized, obviously, non-custodial and permissioned.

## Decentralized Protocols
In research phase, everything below is preliminary:

1. Lido
2. Rocket Pool
3. Diva
   Hasnâ€™t launched yet. They will be a dvt focused lst with permissionless nodes
5. Swell
6. Stader
   Not in operation, yet.
  Multichain. ETHx is their Ethereum token.
  Permissioned + permissionless NOs.
  Have pledged self-limiting at 22%
   
8. Ether fi
9. Stakewise (Swise) (include v3)
   Current version is semi-decentralized and permissioned. Shares many of the same NOs as Lido.
   - Stakewise the company (>50%)
   - Yorick
   - Telekom
   - Finoa
   - Verihash
10. Frax (include v2)
    Currently, basically a CEX (one Frax node run by them).
    v2 has potential, though.
12. Ankr? Does that even count?
13. Origin? I think that is not even staking

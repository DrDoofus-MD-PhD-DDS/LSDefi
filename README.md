# LSDefi

Notes on the current LST landscape, in particular, for Rocket Pool Peers who need quick education on the state of Ethereum liquid staking.

## CEX Staking
Centralized, obviously, non-custodial and permissioned.

## Decentralized Protocols
In research phase, everything below is preliminary:

1. Lido
2. Rocket Pool
3. Diva
   Hasnâ€™t launched yet. They will be a dvt focused lst with permissionless nodes
   Staking Tool (rather than protocol)
   LST passive or NO for additional rewards
   Diva is tool built on DVT tech (sort of like a layer 2 validation)
   6-28 DAO launch - governance tokens initially airdropped to community (non-transferrable, no value)
   Mainnet Q4 2023
   non-custodial NO responsibility - key is distributed
   Low skill to inplement
   no MEV, penalties yet, etc.
   validators find others on their own to DVT with
   All ETH is staked ... either get LST back or lockto get keysfor validaintg
     if lock you get additional rewards
   could share with RP node
   3.5 million raised
   Diva like SSV, will search for available validators, if you lock you will get picked for validating (obol unlike ssav is people pick each otehr to validate with)
   with single ETH can lock to be part of validators
   community will decide if they should self-limit
   no DAO fee, stakers get 90% NOs 10% should be better rewards than Lido since DVT allows more uptime/efficiency etc.
5. Swell
6. Stader
   Not in operation, yet.
  Multichain. ETHx is their Ethereum token.
  Permissioned + permissionless NOs.
  Have pledged self-limiting at 22%
   
8. Ether fi
9. Stakewise (Swise) (include v3)
   Current version is semi-decentralized and permissioned. Shares many of the same NOs as Lido.
   - Stakewise the company (>50%)
   - Yorick
   - Telekom
   - Finoa
   - Verihash
10. Frax (include v2)
    Currently, basically a CEX (one Frax node run by them).
    v2 has potential, though.
12. Ankr? Does that even count?
13. Origin? I think that is not even staking
